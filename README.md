# ES-QR
ES-QR Project is a desktop application for parking lots, integrated with the API of Metcom License Plate Recognition Systems company. A QR Code is created when the person enters the car park, and when he leaves, he shows that QR Code to the camera and exits the car park. 

NOTE:I can't share the Local API but you can create your own API and try this app by yourself. But you need a printer for qr code :D
